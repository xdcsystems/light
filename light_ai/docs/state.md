# State notes (light_ai)

The accumulating record that used to live at the end of README.md:
INT8 build history, INT8 vs FP32 validation and the night-session
findings (incl. the dataset map). Pointers like [Platform constraints],
[M2.4], [M2.6] below refer to README.md sections (../README.md).

## INT8 build history (rknn-toolkit2 2.5.0, Colab)

Versions in misc/ (build lineage):
- yolov5s_relu.rknn — fp16-convert build without quantization; the
  accuracy reference for every A/B.
- yolov5s_relu_int8.rknn — v1: default KLD quantization, mixed
  calibration; superseded (night ALARM — see M2.4).
- yolov5s_relu_int8_mmse.rknn / _v2.rknn — mmse, 50 frames
  (dataset_mix); the working model since 2026-10-30.
- yolov5s_relu_int8_v3.rknn — mmse. The build records disagree:
  one history notes a 6000-frame evening dump
  (cal_evening_6000.tgz), M2.4 records 60 fresh day-4 daytime
  frames with the canonical 1/255 scale (0.00392157) — the same
  filename was evidently reused across builds; treat the M2.4
  record as the current v3 state.
- yolov5s_relu_int8_v4.rknn — mmse on the fresh 960p daytime dump
  (dataset_day3: 50 frames, every 2nd of 100). Day, dusk and night
  A/Bs vs v3 — equal (2026-10-30, status below; night: one isolated
  frame loss, see below).

v4 recipe (build_v4.py; Colab notebook Untitled2.ipynb, a copy is
saved as colab_v4_recipe.ipynb in artifacts): mean [0,0,0],
std [255,255,255], quant_img_RGB2BGR=False,
quantized_method='channel', quantized_algorithm='mmse',
target_platform='rk3588', optimization_level=3,
do_quantization=True, dataset = 50 png. Build time 48 min (mmse
~31 s per iteration, 90 iterations; Colab log: DONE 2884.1 s).

Toolkit facts (Colab side):
- Colab does NOT support swap (fallocate / loop device / separate
  disk are all rejected by the kernel): mmse memory is capped by
  the 12 GB RAM -> at most 50 frames of 960p calibration.
  Verified.
- Expected input scale under mmse: ~0.004-0.0045. A flat 1/255
  (0.00392157) is the signature of the default algorithm, not
  mmse. Verify after each build: grep 'scale' build_v4.log.
- Toolkit 2.5.0 converts input AND outputs to int8 by default;
  deploying through the Runtime API means accounting for the
  dequant scale. RknnEngine already rewrites the output attr to
  FLOAT16 so the runtime dequantizes into the zero-copy buffer
  (see RknnEngine) — postprocess stays untouched; the "outputs
  are native fp16" note above refers to non-quantized builds.
- onnx source: yolov5s_relu.onnx, 28.9 MB, wget from
  ftrg.zbox.filez.com (link alive on 2026-10-30).
- Calibration dumps are duplicated to Drive; artifacts live in
  Drive (yolov5_rknn) and on the board (misc/). Colab-side
  files: postprocess.py (YOLOv5 decode: anchors 80/40/20,
  strides 8/16/32, NMS; input = 3 maps (255,H,W) post-sigmoid)
  and build_v4.py.

Status 2026-10-30 (v3-vs-v4 A/B):
- Day (dataset_day2, 50 frames): conf 0.25 — 101 vs 101
  detections; the discrepancies are threshold noise (cls 39,
  scores 0.256/0.259).
- Dusk (dataset_dusk, 100 frames, brightness ~86 vs ~116
  daytime): conf 0.18 — 223 vs 227 detections, ALL discrepancies
  sit in the 0.18-0.24 score band (mostly cls 56; symmetric
  split: 12 v4-only vs 8 v3-only, 37 IoU-matched); conf 0.25 —
  186 vs 186, two frames differ by one detection.
- Verdict: v4 == v3 on the daytime and dusk profiles; the mean
  dusk score is even slightly higher for v4 (0.491 vs 0.478).
- Note: these are INT8-vs-INT8 A/Bs; the v3-vs-fp16 day A/B of
  M2.4-b (a) stays open.
- Night (dataset_mix, 50 frames, --gamma 2.0, conf 0.18;
  v3/v4/mmse): 102/106/98 detections over 48/47/49 of 50 frames —
  no night blindness in any version. IoU v3-vs-v4: 98 matched,
  7 v3-only / 8 v4-only, all in the 0.18-0.24 band EXCEPT ONE:
  n2_cal_0040 — v3 cls56 0.3574, mmse cls56 0.3808 (boxes agree
  within ~1 px), v4 sees NOTHING on that frame. A zone trace of
  that object across all 23 n2 frames: detected by v3 20/23,
  v4 19/23, mmse 20/23 — v4's miss is a single-frame quantization
  collapse, not systematic blindness (frames 0032/0072/0080 are
  missed by ALL three: edge-object absence, cf. M2.4). mmse stays
  the steadiest night profile (coverage 49/50, no lost detections).
- Verdict (2026-10-30, evening): v4 survives the night profile —
  v3-equivalent except one isolated lost detection. M2.6 (d) is
  closed as INT8-vs-INT8. The live night session (mmse vs v4)
  ran the same evening: EQUAL — mmse confirmed as the working
  model. Still open: the M2.4-b (a) day A/B vs fp16.
- Working-model decision (owner, 2026-10-30 evening): int8_mmse
  STAYS the working model — steadier at night (49/50 coverage, no
  losses) and proven across the live sessions. v4 is kept as the
  day/dusk candidate (fresher 960p calibration, higher dusk score
  0.491 vs 0.478). Closure (same evening): live night session done — mmse vs v4,
  600 frames each, conf 0.25, static scene, /dev/video20.
  RESULT: EQUAL. Steady blocks 120-599: no block diverges
  (2.02-2.05 vs 2.00-2.17 det/frame); chair 100% presence both,
  mean conf 0.827 vs 0.832; potted plant in every frame both,
  mean conf 0.670 vs 0.719; vase 4% frames both (mmse scores it
  higher: 0.413/0.571 vs 0.285/0.345); zero anomalous frames in
  either run. Infer on the night camera = 24 ms, same as day —
  no night NPU penalty. First two blocks (warmup tail, vase
  fading at mmse start) are excluded, per M2.4 protocol.
- Conf-0.18 control (same evening, 240 frames each, static
  scene): cup and dining table ABSENT at 0.18 in both models —
  night absence, not a threshold effect. mmse again the
  conservative profile: vase in 14/240 frames (5%) vs 63/240
  (26%) for v4; weak (<0.30) off-profile detections 36 vs 162.
  Class-set divergence 70/240 frames, all driven by the
  0.18-0.26 noise band (vase episodes, phantom potted plant at
  ~(471,578)); main profile (chair + potted plant) intact in
  both. v4 note: empty frame 0 (cold-start miss) — second
  early-frame collapse pattern after M2.4 v3/vase. Decision
  unchanged: mmse stays the working model.

## INT8 vs FP32 validation (2026-10-26, yolov5s_relu_int8_v2)

Purpose: verify the freshly calibrated int8 model (v2) against a float32
reference on identical inputs — quantization verdict for the M2.4 re-check
(path B). The v1 ALARM (box shift ~17 px, dconf -0.04) predates this
recalibration; this section documents v2.

Methodology:
- 50 calibration frames (n1_cal_*/n2_cal_*), 640x640, same gamma-2.0 -> uint8
  -> /255 preprocessing on both sides.
- FP32 reference: yolov5s_relu.onnx via onnxruntime (Colab), artifacts
  misc/ref_preds.csv; INT8: RKNNLite on board, tools/save_board_csv.py ->
  misc/board_preds.csv; comparison tools/compare.py + tools/list_missed.py
  (IoU>0.5 + class match, mean |dscore|).

Pitfall learned: the ONNX model does NOT normalize its input (rknn divides
by 255 internally, std=255 in the quant config). Feeding raw 0..255 to
onnxruntime saturates the model -> hundreds of phantom detections. Input
must be 0..1.

Results:

| conf (both) | FP32 det | INT8 det | matched | missed | extra | mean \|dscore\| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | 89 | 89 | 86 (96.6%) | 3 | 3 | 0.028 |
| 0.25 ref / 0.18 int8 | 89 | 98 | 89 (100%) | 0 | 9 | 0.028 |
| 0.18 | 101 | 98 | 97 (96.0%) | 4 | 1 | 0.028 |

Conclusions:
- v2 INT8 == FP32 within noise: mean |dscore| 0.028 at both thresholds, box
  geometry matches to a pixel, no loss of any detection with score >= 0.30.
  All discrepancies sit in the 0.18-0.29 band (threshold-edge candidates).
  Missed at 0.25: cls58 (0.2509/0.2874/0.2561). Missed at 0.18: cls75
  (0.1831), cls39 (0.1893), cls58 (0.2205), cls41 (0.1825) — FP32 scores,
  i.e. objects the FP32 model itself was unsure about.
- Lowering the board conf to 0.18 pulls those edge candidates back; the 9
  "extra" detections at 0.18 are stable recurring objects (same boxes across
  frames: cls39 at ~(249,368)-(259,396), cls58 at ~(295,376)-(347,482)), not
  noise. Working conf for v2: 0.18-0.20 (v3: 0.25 — see M2.4).
- v1 box-shift ALARM is superseded for v2: no systematic shift on the
  calibration set (within-pixel agreement). M2.4 night A/B was re-run
  on v2 (2026-10-26): ALARM confirmed — see the last bullet below;
  M2.4 is closed on v3.
- Dark blindness (n2_cal_0096, n2_cal_0152: 0 detections) is identical in
  FP32 and INT8 — quantization-independent, a data/scene problem.
- Class-flip observation: the recurring object at ~(248,366)-(260,396) gets
  cls75/cls39/cls41 across frames; verify against ground-truth labels later.
- Night A/B on the board (2026-10-26, live camera): v2 ALARM confirmed
  (systematic dconf -0.045 vs fp16, vase never detected) — superseded by
  v3; see M2.4 for the closed verdict.

## Night session findings (2026-10-26): dark frames and gamma verdict

Dataset map (owner's clarification; current as of 2026-10-30):
- dataset_day2    — day-2 daytime dump, 50 frames cal_00XX.ppm
  (brightness two clusters: ~89 and ~114). The day A/B reference
  for the v3-vs-v4 comparison (2026-10-30).
- dataset_day3    — fresh 960p daytime dump (2026-10-30,
  --cal 100 --cal-interval 15): 100 frames, brightness ~116
  uniform. The quantization source of v4 (every 2nd frame = 50).
- dataset_dusk    — dusk dump (2026-10-30, same protocol): 100
  frames, brightness ~86 (vs ~116 daytime). cal_0000.ppm is an
  AE-settling outlier (brightness 35) — exclude it from any
  future calibration.
- The former day-4 daytime dump (the old dataset/, 60 frames:
  pre-letterboxed 640x640 network input, gray-128 padding rows
  0-139 and 500-639, ~44% of pixels, content 640x360 centered;
  one static daytime view; people intermittently cross the scene,
  occluding the lower half, Rmean 78-82 -> 53-57 in occluded
  frames, upper half unchanged, k=1.0; v3's quantization input,
  built 20:20 on 2026-10-26) is archived — duplicated to Drive.
  The dataset/ path was reused for fresh dumps (2026-10-30:
  dataset -> dataset_day3, then a fresh dump -> dataset_dusk).
- dataset_night/  — NIGHT calibration dump, day 1, the buggy
  pipeline that periodically produced row-tear artifacts.
  Hardest conditions for the model; all gamma probes ran on it.
  All cal_XXXX frame references in this section and in the
  dark-frame probes point HERE, not to the daytime dumps
- dataset_mix/    — calibration dump assembled proportionally
  from day-2 and night-1 frames; THE calibration set of
  int8_v2 / int8_mmse (50 frames: n1_cal_* every 2nd of 50,
  n2_cal_* every 8th of 200); v3's calibration set is separate —
  60 fresh day-4 daytime frames (see M2.4).
- There is NO retrained FP32. The earlier session note "model
  retrained on dataset_mix" was wrong: dataset_mix is a
  calibration set (unlabeled dumps), Colab has no runs/, no
  best.pt/last.pt exists. Any future training on night scenes
  needs labeled data.

Dark-frame classes (night_survey*.py, probe_dark_heads.py,
probe_gamma_sweep.py):
- "alive in darkness": cal_0037 (band median 3, max_obj 0.83),
  cal_0149, cal_0065 —
  backlight: dark silhouette against a bright doorway; the model sees these.
- "revive under extra gamma": cal_0096, cal_0152 — signal exists, outside the
  training domain; gamma 3.0 brings them back.
- "dead regardless": cal_0067 (person very close to camera, max
  scale + heavy row tears), cal_0068 (confirmed visually: row
  tears across the whole frame, scene unreadable — legacy-dump
  quality, not the camera). Untreatable by gamma; future
  treatment is data (needs labeling).

Gamma 3.0 verdict (tools/probe_gamma3_det.py, int8_v2, full decode+NMS, band
[140,500) filter, results in misc/gamma3_det.csv):
- Total gamma is negative for BOTH domains: dark — coverage up
  (131 -> 142 frames with detections) but detections down
  310 -> 261 (-16%), the stable recurring plant (cls58, 28
  consecutive frames) dies entirely; bright — count ~flat but
  mean conf drops (0.448 -> 0.382 @0.18), -19 detections @0.25.
- Conditional gamma (dark only): +14 revived frames (incl. cal_0030 person 0.81
  confirmed visually: real backlit silhouette (person) in
  doorway + potted plant, row-tear artifacts present,
  cal_0047/0100/0152 chairs 0.4-0.6) minus 3 fully killed
  frames and ~50 detections; also noise revivals (cal_0154 cls13 0.45).
- VERDICT (owner's decision): conditional gamma 3.0 NOT adopted — "considered;
  detection A/B: insufficient gain for the loss of a stable
  class". A gamma change would also require a fresh calibration
  anyway (the v2 scale 0.00436174 is fitted to the
  old distribution; v3 uses canonical 1/255, also
  distribution-dependent).
- Adaptive gain by band median stays rejected (probe_adaptive.py).
- Remaining dark-frame lever: fresh clean night dump -> v3 recalibration
  (DONE 2026-10-26 — M2.4 closed on v3).
